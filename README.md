# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for Safaricom using a synthetic dataset. The steps include dataset creation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment of a dashboard using cursor.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Streamlit
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run `cursor` to start the analysis.
4. Use the Flask app to make predictions.


## Dataset
A synthetic dataset simulating customer interactions with Safaricom, including features that impact churn likelihood.

## Steps
1. Dataset Creation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Deployment Dashboard
7. App creation

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates building a churn prediction model. Future work includes implementing real customer data and exploring additional models.
